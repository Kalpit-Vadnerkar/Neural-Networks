# Neural-Networks for Digit and Letter Classification
A Neural Network An architecture with 5 layers in the neural network. Among the 5 layers there are 4 hidden layers having different sizes. The 4 hidden layers have the number of units initialized as 250, 500, 250, and 100 with random initial weights ranging from 0 to 0.01.
